    Net::Statsd::Server::Changes - Change history for Net::Statsd::Server

  Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.06   17th January 2013
      Added new File backend.
        It allows to flush all aggregated stats to a given log file.

      Added keyFlush implementation.
        Allows to have the top n% (keyFlush.percent) dumped to a
        log file (keyFlush.log) or stdout every y seconds
        (keyFlush.interval).

  Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.05   16th January 2013
      Improved UDP socket default settings to perform better.
        In my tests, Net::Statsd::Server manages to successfully capture
        almost twice the amount of UDP traffic (otherwise lost) than
        the original node.js based statsd, with SO_RCVBUF = 8Mb.
        I still have to experiment a bit more with this setting though.

  Changes in Net::Statsd::Server 0.04   15th January 2013
      Fixed statistics flush. When a flush is triggered, stats have
        to be cleared. The flush code wasn't doing this previously.

      Fixed management commands (:8126) to output correct JSON data
        structures.

      This is the first fully functional statsd server release.

  Net::Statsd::Server 0.01 - 0.03            January 2013
      First release on an unsuspecting world.
