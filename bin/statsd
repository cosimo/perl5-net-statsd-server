=head1 NAME

statsd - Simple daemon for easy stats aggregation

=head1 DESCRIPTION (the original node.js-based statsd)

A network daemon that runs on the Node.js platform and
listens for statistics, like counters and timers, sent over B<UDP>
and sends aggregates to one or more pluggable backend services (e.g.,
C<Graphite>).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the Perl port of the node.js statsd B<server>.
Please consult statsd documentation available at:

  https://github.com/etsy/statsd

If you're looking for a Perl B<client> for C<statsd>, then
have a look here:
